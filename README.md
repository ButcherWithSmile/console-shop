This is a small practice project to develop a RESTful API using the Go programming language and the Gin framework. It simulated a console shop in which you can view the list of available consoles in this shop, add a new item to the existing list, or access a specific console by its ID. To run this project, all you need is to run it on your local host "localhost:8880".
